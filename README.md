Even though this repo is vastly belated, I’m glad I finally made it. I did more challenges than in this list so if you want to see a specific challenge just send me a message. Chances are that I already did it, or, if not, will do it when I have time. I won’t be uploading solutions to exceptionally easy challenges unless requested.

If you have any questions/suggestions/criticism, spot an error etc. please don’t hesitate to contact me via:
* Email: fjeremicwork@gmail.com
* Discord: Focho#1982

Note: all the C++ solutions are C++14 because that is the latest version which is supported by HackerRank

Have fun!
